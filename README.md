# Alwahid Project

**Note:** This project is not yet complete. It is a personal hobby project built for learning purposes and with the belief that society could benefit from a way to better manage social media content, especially related to religious topics, to help guide people on the right path.

## Project Overview

The **Alwahid Project** is a platform designed to support the Muslim community, focusing on religious content and guidance. The application defines three user roles, each with its own unique responsibilities.

### User Roles

1. **Admin**
   - Multiple admins are responsible for managing application data.
   - Admins are appointed by the application owner, referred to as BOG.
   - Admins have the authority to delete or remove any content or user.
   - They can approve manager applications and assign them to manage content.

2. **Managers**
   - Managers can create and upload posts, add events, and map new mosques.

3. **Special User**
   - These users are scholars or Ulama. Regular users can ask them questions or arrange meetings.

4. **Normal User**
   - Standard users with the ability to like, comment, and view posts.
